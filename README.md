# 🚨 Drug Trafficker Detection Game

An interactive, HTML-based web game that lets players act as an airport security officer and identify potential drug traffickers based on clues and suspicious behavior. Built using simple **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this educational mini-game is designed to raise awareness on how human trafficking and drug smuggling often go unnoticed in plain sight.

## 🎮 Game Concept

You are given a series of **airport security cases**. For each case, you will:
- Read the scenario
- Analyze the clues
- Review a list of 3 suspects
- Choose the one you believe is the trafficker

Immediate feedback is provided after each choice. The goal is to catch all the right suspects across multiple levels!
